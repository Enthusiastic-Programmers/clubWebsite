    <p>
                        This year many new members have joined our club as we provide help and guidance to those taking computer science classes. Additionally, many students are always thinking of new innovative ideas but sometimes are not sure where to start, and so we also help them get started with their ideas. A couple of the projects the club has worked on are one like this website(hackathon ideas, space balloon project). We have also worked on many project ideas at Hackathons. One of our main focus for the students in club is to attend Hackathons. These events are so amazing and fun and provide great chances for students to get involved to learn and make an idea actually happen, show off to real big companies for potential buisness or job opportunities, and meeting new great smart people to keep in contact with. Many big companies sponser these events, which help fund and make the event happen, but also these sponsers usually have categories in which the best project wins a variety of prizes! Below will be some links of more info on these actual Hackathon projects.

It used OpenCV and Microsoft's Computer Vision API to detect people and translate writing into documents.(2019)</p>

This team won a prize category for best domain name, getting raspberry pi kits.

    <li> <p class="hack-text">LAHacks: </p> <p><a href="https://devpost.com/software/la-hacks-4kmu5s"> Project 1-</a> Car Pal, the future all around car assistant tool. Report drunk drivers or other illegal unsafe driving with a tap of a button, or with speech in the future, sending dashcam footage, their license plate number, and your car location to authorities. Also report other road hazards such as potholes or roablocks to drivers around the area to help prevent traffic or accidents. This project won 2nd place for the SmartCar API category, winning some amazon gift cards and thousands of dollars in their API credits to continue this project. (2019) </p>
