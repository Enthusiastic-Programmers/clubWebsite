        <span style="font-size:28px">&nbsp;Ethan Bonavida</span> is the president of the Computer Science club here at Moorpark College.
        as the president of our very special club, Ethan has many jobs, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
            FA
        <li>Looking awesome</li>
        <li>Attracting the babez</li>
        <li>Charming faculty into increasing the club budget</li>
        <li>Bringing back prizes as the people's champion</li>
        <li style="text-decoration:line-through;font-size:10px;">Forcing club members to write websites for him</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Now I know what you're thinking here: there couldn't possibly be a man capable of doing all these things. 
        Well, you're right: Ethan is actually 1/36th part <span style="color: darkred">redwood</span>. I don't know how that works 
        either, but it means he's not <span style="font-style: oblique;">just</span> a man. We haven't noticed anything very redwood 
        about him, though.
    </p>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;However, upon being elected president of the Enthusiastic Programmers club, the Bonafide Bonavida 
        gained the power of omniscience, which only increased the radiance of his awesome. Instead of having 50 times the 
        power level of a regular human, he now has an effectively infinite advantage over the average person. This makes 
        him even more capable of the job entrusted to him by the good club members of Enthusiastic Programmers.
    </p>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;This hero is so well liked, that he often can't play his recent favorite game, Destiny 2, in peace and quiet 
        from his bothersome followers' questions and attention. The following is a graph showing the amount of disappointment 
        accrued from Ethan's dismissal:
